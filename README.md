Tutorial that I followed is [here](https://github.com/huffleman51/js-stack-from-scratch/blob/master/tutorial/08-bootstrap-jss.md#readme).

# What I learned in this module

1. Twitter Bootstrap is a library of UI components.
1. There are 2 options to integrate Bootstrap in a React app. Both have their pros and cons:
  * Using the official release, which uses jQuery and Tether for the behavior of its components.
  * Using a third-party library that re-implements all of Bootstrap's components in React, like React-Bootstrap or Reactstrap.
  * This tutorial decided to use Bootstrap which used jQuery and Tether
1. I copied and pasted a bunch of code without really understanding what is going on. This is one thing that I don't like about this tutorial.
1. Added Bootstrap code to style the pages and add a navigation bar
